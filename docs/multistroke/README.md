# Multistroke Words

You now have full control over the sounds that the steno layout is able to express. Even though you only have 24 keys at your disposal, you're able to form complex syllable sounds using the base keys, hidden sounds, compound sounds, and the number bar.

At this point, you have all the tools necessary to understand even the most advanced steno chords. What comes next is **stringing together multiple strokes.** It may already be clear to you from experimentation or from watching stenographers write, but not every word can be keyed in a single chord.

There are actually a of couple strategies to handle multistroke words. We'll first look at **prefixes and suffixes** which are a very powerful paradigm for writing with stenography. When prefixes and suffixes aren't sufficient, we reach for other tools, such as **omitting unemphasized vowels** and **sounding things out.**

After this chapter, you'll:

- Have the tools you need to write every single English word, including ones not defined in the Plover dictionary.
- Your understanding of the theory will be complete, meaning that you can move on to higher-level concepts such as writing your own briefs, modifying your dictionary, speedbuilding, and using steno for other purposes.
