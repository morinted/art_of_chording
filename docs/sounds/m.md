# Both sides M

This lesson covers how you write the initial and final M sound on the steno layout.

## Left side M

Left side M is made with the combination `PH` on the left side.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="M" />

- `PHA`: ma
- `PHAD`: mad
- `PHUD`: mud
- `PHEUL`: mill
- `PHAUL`: mall
- `PHELT`: melt
- `PHUL`: mull

## Right side M

Right side M is made with the combination `-PL`. This _does_ conflict with words ending in "ple" like "apple" versus "am". However, the final M is much more common in English so in steno `-PL` defaults to final M.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-M" />

- `APL`: am
- `SOPL`: some
- `THEPL`: them
- `KOPL`: come
- `PHOPL`: mom
- `PHUPL`: mum
- `TOPL`: Tom
- `PHRUPL`: plumb
- `STORPL`: storm
- `PHAPL`: ma'am
- `TEPLT`: tempt
