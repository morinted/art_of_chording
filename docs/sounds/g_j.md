# Both sides G and J

_Special thanks to _[_Mirabai Knight_](http://stenoknight.com)_ for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write the G and J sounds in steno, such as those found in "gift", "ground", "George", and "gif".

## Left side G

The hard G sound is formed on the left hand with `TKPW`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="G" />

* `TKPWO`: go
* `TKPWET`: get
* `TKPWOPB`: gone
* `TKPWUT`: gut
* `TKPWEURL`: girl
* `TKPWAEUT`: gait
* `TKPWOUT`: gout
* `TKPWRAEUD`: grade

## Right side G as -ing

You've learned words that end with `-G` like `PWAPBG` for "bang" and `TKOG` for "dog". Another _very_ common usage in the Plover dictionary is `-G` as "-ing". You can add `-G` to many words to give them the "-ing" suffix, just like you do with `-D` for "-ed" and `-S` and `-Z` for "-s".

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-G" />

Note that this "folded-in" suffix is even allowed to break steno order if there is no conflict.

* `TKPWO`: go
  * `TKPWOG`: going
* `PAEU`: pay
  * `PAEUG`: paying
* `-B`: be
  * `-BG`: being
* `PWAEUT`: bait
  * `PWAEUGT`: baiting
* `WAFP`: watch
  * `WAFPG`: watching
* `POUT`: pout
  * `POUGT`: pouting

## Left side J

The left side J and soft G sounds are formed on the left hand with `SKWR`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="J" />

* `SKWRAR`: jar
* `SKWROPB`: John
* `SKWRABG`: jack
* `SKWREUPL`: gym
* `SKWREUF`: gif

## Right side J

The Right side J and soft G sounds are formed on the right hand with `PBLG`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-J" />

* `AEUPBLG`: age
* `TKPWRUPBLG`: grudge
* `SKWRUPBLG`: judge
* `SKWRORPBLG`: George
* `TKPWORPBLG`: gorge
* `TKPWAEUPBLG`: gauge
* `TKPWRUPBLG`: grudge

On some hardware, pressing this many keys might be difficult. Make sure you aren't trying to just use your fingers, your forearms should be the main source of power. Better steno hardware will also require less force.
