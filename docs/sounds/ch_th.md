# Both sides CH and TH

_Special thanks to _[_Scott Pierce_](https://ddrscott.github.io)_ for funding this lesson._

## Left side CH

Since there is no C key on the layout, we substitute `K` and use `KH` for initial CH.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="KH" />

- `KHAT`: chat
- `KHOP`: chop
- `KHART`: chart

## Right side CH

Words ending with the "tch" or "ch" sound are made on the right hand with `-FP`. It's also used if there is a homophone where the only differentiator is spelling.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-FP" />

- `WAFP`: watch
- `SWAFP`: swatch
- `HAFP`: hatch
- `PWAFP`: batch
- `KAFP`: catch
- `HRAFP`: latch
- `TEFP`: tech \(spelling\). You can also use `TEBG` \(phonetic\)

## Left side TH

You've already learned initial TH in previous lessons as it's just `TH`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="TH" />

- `THAUT`: thought

## Right side TH

The first use of the asterisk for us is with final "th". Adding an asterisk to a chord with a `-T` in it will make a "th" sound. `*T` is the "th" sound.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="*T" />

- `WRA*T`: wrath
- `PWA*T`: bath
- `PA*T`: path
- `TK*ET`: death
- `*ERT`: earth
- `TKA*RT`: darth
- `HA*T`: hath
- `WO*RT`: worth
