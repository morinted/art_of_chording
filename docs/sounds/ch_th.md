# Both sides CH and TH

_Special thanks to _[_Scott Pierce_](https://ddrscott.github.io)_ for funding this lesson._

### Left side CH

Since there is no C key on the layout, we substitute `K` and use `KH` for initial CH.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
KH
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `KHAT`: chat
* `KHOP`: chop
* `KHART`: chart

### Right side CH

Words ending with the "tch" or "ch" sound are made on the right hand with `-FP`. It's also used if there is a homophone where the only differentiator is spelling.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-FP
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `WAFP`: watch
* `SWAFP`: swatch
* `HAFP`: hatch
* `PWAFP`: batch
* `KAFP`: catch
* `HRAFP`: latch
* `TEFP`: tech \(spelling\). You can also use `TEBG` \(phonetic\)

### Left side TH

You've already learned initial TH in previous lessons as it's just `TH`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
TH
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `THAUT`: thought


### Right side TH

The first use of the asterisk for us is with final "th". Adding an asterisk to a chord with a `-T` in it will make a "th" sound. `*T` is the "th" sound.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
*T
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `WRA*T`: wrath
* `PWA*T`: bath
* `PA*T`: path
* `TK*ET`: death
* `*ERT`: earth
* `TKA*RT`: darth
* `HA*T`: hath
* `WO*RT`: worth
