# Vowel oh

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers the "oh" sound heard in words like "dome" as well as your first shortening principle.

---

The vowel sound "oh" is given by the outline `OE`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="OE" />

- `OE`: owe
- `OEPB`: own
- `OEPL`: ohm
- `PHOE`: mow
- `TOE`: tow
- `TPHOE`: know
- `TPHOEZ`: knows
- `TPHOES`: nose
- `SHOE`: show
- `PWHROE`: blow
- `PWHROEPB`: blown
- `HROE`: low
- `PWOEPB`: bone
- `HROEPB`: lone
- `SOE`: sow
- `PWOE`: bow
- `TKOE`: dough

***But there's a catch!***

Plover Theory spells words with "or" in them \(corn, born, etc.\) with just the normal `O` instead of `OE`. The `OER` version is reserved for briefs.

- `KORPB`: corn
  - `KOERPB`: coroner
- `PWORPB`: born
  - `PWOERPB`: borne
- `TKORPL`: dorm
  - not defined \(`TKOERPL` is unmapped\)
- `TORPB`: torn
  - `TOERPB`: attorney
- `STOR`: store
  - `STOER`: story
- `STORPL`: storm
  - `STOERPL`: stormy

- `PHOR`: more

  - `PHOER`: mother

You are not expected to remember these `OER` briefs for the practice material in this book yet, but you are free to use them, of course.

## Shortening Technique: mo'er and fa'er

Stenographers are always concerned with smashing as many syllables into as few strokes as possible. In the space between raw theory and arbitrary briefs, there are _shortening techniques_. Shortening techniques are little rules that you can use to develop a family of briefs.

One recurring pattern in the Plover dictionary is squashing two syllable words with the "o'e" pattern into one stroke:

- `OER`: other \(o'er\)
- `PHOER`: mother \(mo'er\)
- `PAERPB`: pattern \(pa'ern\)
- `TPAER`: father \(fa'er\)
- `WAUR`: water \(wa'er\)
- `TKAUR`: daughter \(dau'er\)
- `PWOER`: bother \(bo'er\)

You can imagine speaking in a Cockney accent if it helps you remember this pattern. You substitute the middle consonant with a stop.
