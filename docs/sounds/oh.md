# Vowel oh

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers the "oh" sound heard in words like "dome" as well as your first shortening principle.

--------

The vowel sound "oh" is given by the outline `OE`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
OE
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `OE`: owe
* `OEPB`: own
* `OEPL`: ohm
* `PHOE`: mow
* `TOE`: tow
* `TPHOE`: know
* `TPHOEZ`: knows
* `TPHOES`: nose
* `SHOE`: show
* `PWHROE`: blow
* `PWHROEPB`: blown
* `HROE`: low
* `PWOEPB`: bone
* `HROEPB`: lone
* `SOE`: sow
* `PWOE`: bow
* `TKOE`: dough

#### But there's a catch!

Plover Theory spells words with "or" in them \(corn, born, etc.\) with just the normal `O` instead of `OE`. The `OER` version is reserved for briefs.

* `KORPB`: corn
  * `KOERPB`: coroner
* `PWORPB`: born
  * `PWOERPB`: borne
* `TKORPL`: dorm
  * not defined \(`TKOERPL` is unmapped\)
* `TORPB`: torn
  * `TOERPB`: attorney
* `STOR`: store
  * `STOER`
* `STORPL`: storm

  * `STOERPL`: stormy

* `PHOR`: more

  * `PHOER`: mother

You are not expected to remember these `OER` briefs for the practice material in this book yet, but you are free to use them, of course.

## Shortening Technique: mo'er and fa'er

Stenographers are always concerned with smashing as many syllables into as few strokes as possible. In the space between raw theory and arbitrary briefs, there are _shortening techniques_. Shortening techniques are little rules that you can use to develop a family of briefs.

One recurring pattern in the Plover dictionary is squashing two syllable words with the "o'e" pattern into one stroke:

* `OER`: other \(o'er\)
* `PHOER`: mother \(mo'er\)
* `PAERPB`: pattern \(pa'ern\)
* `TPAER`: father \(fa'er\)
* `WAUR`: water \(wa'er\)
* `TKAUR`: daughter \(dau'er\)
* `PWOER`: bother \(bo'er\)

You can imagine speaking in a Cockney accent if it helps you remember this pattern. You substitute the middle consonant with a stop.
