# Vowels you and oo

_Special thanks to _[_Luke Silva_](https://github.com/LukeSilva)_ for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write the vowel sounds in "pure" and "poor".

### A Note On Phonetics

Plover Theory is not strictly phonetic in the boundary between "you" and "oo". Phonologists or anyone familiar with the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) \(IPA\) will see that Plover is not very strict with its vowel boundaries in general. This is because there are 20 vowels in English, but only 14 vowel combinations possible in Plover. Because of that, the boundary between "YOU" and "OO" is mainly one of spelling.

### Vowel you

The "you" vowel is made with the outline `AOU`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
AOU
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `TKAOU`: due
* `AOUS`, `AOUZ`: use
* `TAOUB`: tube
* `TRAOU`: true
* `PAOUR`: pure
* `RAOUL`: rule
* `SKAOU`: skew
* `STAOU`: stew
* `PWHRAOU`: blew
* `SRAOU`: view
* `STAOUPD`: stupid
* `TKAOUD`: dude
* `TAOUPL`: tomb
* `HRAOUBG`: Luke
* `KRAOUS`: cruise
* `KRAOUZ`: crews
* `KRAOUL`: cruel
* `TKAOURG`: during
* `PRAOUPB`: prune
* `KWAOU`: queue

### Words spelled with "oo"

When there is a word spelled with "oo", you stroke it with `AO`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
AO
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `TAO`: too
* `TKPWAOD`: good
* `HRAOBG`: look
* `PHAO`: moo
* `PWAOPL`: boom
* `TAOPB`: toon
* `TKRAOL`: drool
* `KAOL`: cool
* `STAOL`: stool
* `SKAOL`: school
* `PHAOR`: Moore
* `AOF`: oof

### Words spelled with "oa"

We also use the `AO` combination to write out words that have the vowels "oa" like "load". This helps us resolve homophones:

* `LOEPB`: lone
  * `LAOPB`: loan
* `TKPWROEPB`: grown
  * `TKPWRAOPB`: groan
* `TOED`: today \(brief\)
  * `TAOD`: toad
* `SOR`: sore, `SOER`: sorry \(brief\)
  * `SAOR`: soar
* `PWORD`: bored, `PWOERD`: bothered
  * `PWAORD`: board
* `ROED`: rode
  * `RAOD`: road
* `OER`: other, `O*ER`: ore
  * `AOR`: oar

But this combination is also used for "oa" words even when there are no homophones:

* `PWHRAOT`, `PWHROET`: bloat

Finally, this chord can be used if you ever have an "ao" vowel, but these are not very common in English. The only single-syllable examples I have are names which have the asterisk as they conflict with "too" and "moo":

* `TAO*`: Tao
* `PHAO*`: Mao
