# Both sides N

_Special thanks to Wilfried for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write the initial and final N on the steno machine.

The hardest part in writing lessons so far has been avoiding using "N". I've been looking forward to this one.

## Left side N

Left side N is given by the outline `TPH`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
N
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `TPHO`: no
* `TPHOU`: now
* `TPHOT`: not
* `TPHOR`: nor
* `TPHAU`: naw
* `TPHEBG`: neck
* `TPHEUT`: knit
* `TPHAEUL`: nail
* `TPHAEUT`: Nate
* `TPHOEUS`: noise

### Right side N

Right side N is given by the outline `-PB`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-N
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `OPB`: on
* `APB`: an
* `WUPB`: one
* `THAPB`: than
* `THEPB`: then
* `SOPB`: son
* `TPUPB`: fun
* `RUPB`: run
* `KAPBT`: can't
* `WAPBT`: want
* `WEPBT`: went

### Briefs

There are a lot of briefs that use Ns. This is not an extensive list.

### 2. Find Outlines

Find steno outlines that will write these English sentences, including punctuation.

1. He is a boy-man, in my opinion.
2. I can't say what we should do or not, nothing is up to me in this case.
3. On what condition would you continue to watch Bart? Do you want cash?
4. Come on, take any of them, and we will head out. If you do not make a choice we will leave with nothing at all.
5. I said you had a choice and you did not make it before we had to leave. I stated the condition and you failed to pick in a minute so you had to leave with nothing. This is not new or anything.
6. What reason would you do that for?
7. I will continue to work through the season, but the hours are so long.
8. His/her opinions are so-so, I think.
