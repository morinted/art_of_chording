# Vowel ee

_Special thanks to Paolo Michela for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write the vowel sounds in "eel" and "real".

---------

The "ee" vowel is made with the outline `AOE`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
AOE
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `SAOE`: see
* `SAOEG`: seeing
* `AOEL`: eel
* `AOER`: ear
* `KWRAOER`: year
* `AOES`: ease
* `HAOEL`: heel
* `PAOEL`: peel
* `STAOEL`: steel
* `TPAOEL`: feel
* `THAOE`: thee

### Words Spelled with "ea"

There are a lot of homophones that have "ea" instead of "ee"; like "meet" and "meat", "steel" and "steal", and "reel" and "real". To write the "ea" word, use `AE` instead of `AOE`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
AE
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `HAOEL`: heel
  - `HAEL`: heal
* `PHAOET`: meet
  - `PHAET`: meat
* `RAOEL`: reel
  - `RAEL`: real
* `STAOEL`: steel
  - `STAEL`: steal

`AE` can be used to resolve homophones in other vowels, too, like the difference between "bear" and "bare":

- `PWAEUR`: bare
  - `PWAER`: bear
- `HAEUR`: hair
  - `HAER`: hear (word spelled with "ea")
  - `HA*EUR`: heir (asterisk given to less common alternative)
  - `HA*ER`: hare (asterisk given to less common alternative)

### Shortening Principle: Folded-In E

One pattern that you might have started to notice is the folding-in of `E` in a stroke to add an
"ee" sound at the end. For example, `PHAEB` is a brief for "maybe". You can think of the stroke as "mab-ee".
This is best illustrated through examples:

- `PHAEB`: maybe
- `PHAEPB`: many
- `PHAER`: marry
- `SOER`: sorry
- `STOER`: story
- `STOERPL`: stormy
- `KAER`: carry
- `HAEP`: happy
- `SKAER`: scary
