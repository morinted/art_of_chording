# Both sides X

_Special thanks to a Plover community member for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write the initial and final X on the steno machine.

## Left side X

Left side X is given by the outline `KP`. Words in English don't start with an "x" sound, so this outline is used mainly for words that start in "ex" like "expect".

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="X" />

Here are several words that start with "x":

- `KPEU`: xi
- `KPA*PBT`: xanth
- `KPRAEU`: x-ray

The rest of the strokes start with `KP` for "ex":

- `KPEUT`: exit
- `KPEBG`: exec
- `KPEBGT`: expect
- `KPEPLT`: exempt
- `KPALT`: exalt
- `KPHAEUL`: exhale
- `KPAPL`: exam
- `KPEPT`: except
- `KPERPT`: excerpt
- `KPERT`: exert

There are also these notable examples of words that contain an "x" near the beginning:

- `KPEUS`: axis
- `KPOUS`: anxious

## Right side X

Right side X is given by the outline `BGS`, which comes from `BG` being "K" and "KS" having the same sound as "x" in English. The imaginary word "foks" and the word "fox" would sound the same.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-X" />

- `EBGS`: ex
- `TPOBGS`: fox
- `HOEBGS`: hoax
- `HRABGS`: lax
- `TPABGS`: fax
- `TPAUBGS`: faux \(spelling\)
- `TPHRUBGS`: flux
- `WABGS`: wax

## Resolving -KS and -X

You might realize at this point that "ks" words like "tacks" are homophones to "x" words like "tax". In order to resolve this, you can use `BGZ` instead of `BGS` to pluralize "-k" words. Because `BGZ` might be a little tough to finger, you can also pluralize with a separate stroke, writing `TABG -S` instead of `TABGS`.

- `TABG`: tack
- `TABGS`: tax
- `TABGZ`: tacks
- `TABG -S`: tacks
- `TABG -Z`: tacks
