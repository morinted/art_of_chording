# Both sides X

_Special thanks to a Plover community member for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write the initial and final X on the steno machine.

## Left side X

Left side X is given by the outline `KP`. Words in English don't start with an "x" sound, so this outline is used mainly for words that start in "ex" like "expect".

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
X
{% endstenodisplay %}

Here are several words that start with "x":

* `KPEU`: xi
* `KPA*PBT`: xanth
* `KPRAEU`: x-ray

The rest of the strokes start with `KP` for "ex":

* `KPEUT`: exit
* `KPEBG`: exec
* `KPEBGT`: expect
* `KPEPLT`: exempt
* `KPALT`: exalt
* `KPHAEUL`: exhale
* `KPAPL`: exam
* `KPEPT`: except
* `KPERPT`: excerpt
* `KPERT`: exert

There are also these notable examples of words that contain an "x" near the beginning:

* `KPEUS`: axis
* `KPOUS`: anxious

### Right side X

Right side X is given by the outline `BGS`, which comes from `BG` being "K" and "KS" having the same sound as "x" in English. The imaginary word "foks" and the word "fox" would sound the same.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-X
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `EBGS`: ex
* `TPOBGS`: fox
* `HOEBGS`: hoax
* `HRABGS`: lax
* `TPABGS`: fax
* `TPAUBGS`: faux \(spelling\)
* `TPHRUBGS`: flux
* `WABGS`: wax

### Resolving -KS and -X

You might realize at this point that "ks" words like "tacks" are homophones to "x" words like "tax". In order to resolve this, you can use `BGZ` instead of `BGS` to pluralize "-k" words. Because `BGZ` might be a little tough to finger, you can also pluralize with a separate stroke, writing `TABG -S` instead of `TABGS`.

* `TABG`: tack
* `TABGS`: tax
* `TABGZ`: tacks
* `TABG -S`: tacks
* `TABG -Z`: tacks
