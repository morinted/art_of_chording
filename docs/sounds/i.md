# Vowel i

This lesson covers how you write the vowel sound in "ill" and "his".

---

The letter I is missing from the base layout, and is instead made with the chord `EU`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="EU" />

This is the lax version of "i", as found in:

- `EUL`: ill
- `HEUL`: hill
- `PEUT`: pit
- `HEUP`: hip
- `SEUP`: sip
- `STEUL`: still
- `WHEUP`: whip
- `KEUS`: kiss
- `TEULT`: tilt
- `WREUT`: writ

10. `SHE HR WREU PW WHA HREUL SHE HAZ HREUFD TP-PL`

Note: `HEUSZ` and `H*EUS` translate to "hiss". We can't use the phonetic `HEUS` because it's taken up by "his".
