# Left side Y and Z

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write initial Y and Z in steno, like in the words "zoo" and "young".

## Left side Y

Left side Y is given by the outline `KWR`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
Y
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `KWREP`: yep
* `KWRUPL`: yum
* `KWROUR`: your
  * Do **not** use `KWRUR`, you will need it later.
* `KWROUPBG`: young
* `KWRORBG`: York
* `KWROE`: yo

### Left side Z

Left side Z is given by the outline `S*`. However, if there is a conflict, sometimes we get Z from the much larger `STKPW`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
S*
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `S*EUG`: zig
* `SA*G`: zag
* `S*ED`: Zed
* `SA*P`, `STKPWAP`: zap
* `S*EUT`: zit
* `SO*EPB`: zone
* `STKPWEFR`: zephyr
