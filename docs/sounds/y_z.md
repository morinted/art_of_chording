# Left side Y and Z

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write initial Y and Z in steno, like in the words "zoo" and "young".

## Left side Y

Left side Y is given by the outline `KWR`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="Y" />

- `KWREP`: yep
- `KWRUPL`: yum
- `KWROUR`: your
  - Do **not** use `KWRUR`, you will need it later.
- `KWROUPBG`: young
- `KWRORBG`: York
- `KWROE`: yo

## Left side Z

Left side Z is given by the outline `S*`. However, if there is a conflict, sometimes we get Z from the much larger `STKPW`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="S*" />

- `S*EUG`: zig
- `SA*G`: zag
- `S*ED`: Zed
- `SA*P`, `STKPWAP`: zap
- `S*EUT`: zit
- `SO*EPB`: zone
- `STKPWEFR`: zephyr
