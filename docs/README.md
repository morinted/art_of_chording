features:
  - title: Completely Free
    details: Unlike traditional court reporting textbooks and programs, Art of Chording and Plover are part of the Open Steno Project and have freedom built-in.
  - title: Tried and True
    details: Stenography has existed in court rooms for a century. It's used today to power live captions. There is little question that stenography is the best way for a single person to write words with their hands.
  - title: Ergonomic
    details: In steno, your hands are always on the home row. The main motions are powered by arm movement instead of finger movement, meaning there's less strain on your fingers. This is part of why stenographers can write down every word they hear for hours at a time.
