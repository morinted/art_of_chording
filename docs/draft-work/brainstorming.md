<Steno-Display stroke="SKPROUFBLSD" />

## TODO

1. Add `TPH-R` to the Plover dictionary
1. Triage Plover dictionary issues
1. Add tooling around practice material
    - Consider integration with another tool, look at their formats?
1. Make it easier to find the author of art of chording
    - About the author article?
    - Or a footer
1. Do I want interactive examples inside the book, or do I want a system where I link it out to another service like typey type?

## Brainstorming

- Animated steno display for this pageâ€¦ Christmas lights style.
- Add finger-placement indicators to steno display
- Move steno order to end of "The Layout" section, and just mention that the layout reads left-to-right before that.
  - Add arrows to steno order page.
- Add glossary page
- Have midchapter and end-of-chapter review pages
- Convert lessons from Markdown to JavaScript + Vue components.

### Lesson plan for prefixes

I have to go back and introduce prefixes early. I think that maybe between "The Layout" and "Hidden Sounds" I could introduce "Multistroke Words" starting with Prefixes and Suffixes in a little  lesson that covers RE-, A-, -S, -G, and -D. Then I could go on to show multistroke root words and contrast and compare.

This would allow me to introduce more common prefixes and suffixes in hidden sounds, which provide a natural time to introduce certain affixes.

Categorize by... alphabet? Frequency? Similarity?

I want to get Jeff to make illustrations, mainly to draw the exercise sentences. I want a wet rat to be hugged.

In the later lessons I think I'll move more into a format where I have one or two "letters" or stories as opposed to just the drilling sentences.

## Topics to cover

- Capitalization
- Punctuation
- Cursor movement
- Word joining
