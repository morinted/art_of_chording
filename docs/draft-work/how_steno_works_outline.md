# How steno works outline

- Keyboards are like one or two keys, one letter is output
  - Every letter is one key
  - Modifiers like shift change the output
- Steno speeds things up by allowing entire words and phrases to be output by one "chord" which involves many fingers
- Skipping over repetitive tasks is how steno manages to hit speeds of 225 words per minute.
  - Think of how many times the word "company" has been written. And every time, people have to write it out: space, c, o, m, p, a, n, y, space. In steno, company is written all at once with a quick stroke of the keyboard. Spacing is automatic.
- All the words in the English language
  - You don't have to memorize all the words in the English language. Steno has a system where you learn how to build syllable-like sounds through the keyboard, and there's a system mapping those syllable-like sounds to words.
  - For example, simple words like "dog" and "pat" are straightforward.
  - If a word has multiple syllables, it may be composed of multiple strokes. For example, "pastry" is given by "pace + try".
  - Briefs: abbreviations are used to shorten really commonly used words. "W" for "with", "T" for the.
  - Omission: We map complex words to single strokes like "plar" for "particular", "gofmt" for "government".
  - We use "sticky" prefixes and suffixes to build up more complex words. For example, "un" will stick to the next word, so you could make "undone" or "unfun". Adding "S" will make something plural (dog → dogs), adding "D" will make something past-tense (dog → dogged).
  - When we can't write a word or figure it out, we fallback to letter-by-letter spelling, known to stenographers as fingerspelling.
- Capitalization and spacing is automatic. To go even faster, stenography automatically spaces and capitalizes your writings. There are ways to control this system in case you're not writing plain English, but for the most part the steno software knows that if you end a sentence with a period, the next word will be capitalized. It knows that Los Angeles and Tom always have capital letters.
- When someone makes a typo in stenography, it's not a misplaced letter, it's a misplaced sound. Instead of typoing "heer" instead of "here", you'll see typos like "hear" or "heir"—real words that are in the wrong place.

So let's take a sentence and break it down like a stenographer:

Hello world, today I'm learning how a stenographer could break down a sentence in order to capture human speech more quickly than by typing. Unfortunately, it kind of looks like gibberish.

Hell lo worl , toed iim lerng hou ai snog fer ko braik doun ai stens nord to kap tuur huum speech mor kwik li than bi type g . Un fornlt , t kiind f luuks laik jib rish .

Notice that words and strokes don't all map one-to-one. Strokes can be as little as letters or word parts, or could map to multiple words in a phrase.

- hell + lo → hello
- nord → in order

We sound things out:

- jib rish → gibberish
- stens → sentence

There are shortcuts to get longer words:

- ko → could
- t → it
- f → of
- fortunately → fornlt

We can use prefixes and suffixes to build onto root words:

- type g → typing
- un fornlt → unfortunately

Rather than typing 188 characters, the stenographer made 41 strokes to write this sentence. Given that a professional stenographer can stroke chords approximately 3.5 times per second, that would mean it would take just over 10 seconds to write those sentences. The average typist, typing 60 words per minute or 5 characters per second, would take about 37.6 seconds. Our stenographer in this scenario clocks in at 192 words per minute. That's more than three times as fast.

In summary:

Steno uses chording to make use of a smaller number of keys than a keyboard to generate many, many combinations. A chord on a steno machine can be represented roughly by a syllable-like sound, but it can map to anything such as words, letters, symbols, phrases, and more.

Even though making chords on a steno machine is slower than a typist on a keyboard, a stenographer gets more out of each chord and comes out on top.

Steno was originally developed in the late 1800s for taking down spoken word, but has evolved to be used as a general keyboard replacement. It is used by writers, programmers, and office workers in an amateur fashion. This book, as part of the Open Steno Project, aims to bring the art of stenography—the art of speaking through your fingers, _the art of chording_—to everyone's fingers.
