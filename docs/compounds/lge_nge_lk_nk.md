# -lge, -nge, -lk, -nk

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how to write some words that otherwise wouldn't fit in steno order, including "bank", "milk", and "bulge".

## -lge and -nge

Because `-L` and `-PB` share keys with the -J sound (`-PBLG`), we need to use a different pattern to write words ending in -lge and -nge, like "bulge" or "cringe". The solution is simple: just use -G for the -J sound:

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-LG" />

- `PWULG`: bulge
- `TKWULG`: divulge

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-PBG" />

- `KREUPBG`: cringe
- `TEUPBG`: tinge
- `HEUPBG`: hinge

You'll have to exercise caution here, as these chords conflict with words ending in "ing", like "bing". If a word has a hard G sound, it will get the chord, and the soft G version will be writable by adding the asterisk:

- `PWEUPBG`: bing
- `PW*EUPBG`: binge

## \*G as -k

For the same reasons that we can't have `-L` and `-PB` and -J at the same time, we can't have them at the same time as the chord for -k (`-BG`). In order to get -nk and -lk, we add the asterisk:

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="*LG" />

- `*ELG`: elk
- `*EULG`: ilk
- `PH*EULG`: milk
- `S*EULG`: silk
- `PW*ULG`: bulk
- `S*ULG`: sulk

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="*PBG" />

- `*EUPBG`: ink
- `PWA*PBG`: bank
- `HR*EUPBG`: link
- `P*EUPBG`: pink
- `P*UPBG`: punk
- `TP*UPBG`: funk
- `HA*PBG`: Hank
- `KRA*PBG`: crank
- `RA*PBG`: rank
- `SHR*APBG`: shrank
- `SKU*PBG`: skunk
- `PWHR*EUPBG`: blink
- `TKR*UPBG`: drunk

| `SHRAO*EPBG` | slink       | "Sling" and "shrink" occupy the intuitive options for this stroke, so we change the vowel to a tense E sound in order to at least have a way to write it. If you wrote "slink" much more frequently than "shrink" you could swap these definitions. |
