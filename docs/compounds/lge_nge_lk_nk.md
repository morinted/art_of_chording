# -lge, -nge, -lk, -nk

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how to write some words that otherwise wouldn't fit in steno order, including "bank", "milk", and "bulge".

### -lge and -nge

Because `-L` and `-PB` share keys with the -J sound (`-PBLG`), we need to use a different pattern to write words ending in -lge and -nge, like "bulge" or "cringe". The solution is simple: just use -G for the -J sound:

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-LG
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `PWULG`: bulge
* `TKWULG`: divulge

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-PBG
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `KREUPBG`: cringe
* `TEUPBG`: tinge
* `HEUPBG`: hinge

You'll have to exercise caution here, as these chords conflict with words ending in "ing", like "bing". If a word has a hard G sound, it will get the chord, and the soft G version will be writable by adding the asterisk:

* `PWEUPBG`: bing
* `PW*EUPBG`: binge

### *G as -k

For the same reasons that we can't have `-L` and `-PB` and -J at the same time, we can't have them at the same time as the chord for -k (`-BG`). In order to get -nk and -lk, we add the asterisk:

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
*LG
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `*ELG`: elk
* `*EULG`: ilk
* `PH*EULG`: milk
* `S*EULG`: silk
* `PW*ULG`: bulk
* `S*ULG`: sulk

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
*PBG
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `*EUPBG`: ink
* `PWA*PBG`: bank
* `HR*EUPBG`: link
* `P*EUPBG`: pink
* `P*UPBG`: punk
* `TP*UPBG`: funk
* `HA*PBG`: Hank
* `KRA*PBG`: crank
* `RA*PBG`: rank
* `SHR*APBG`: shrank
* `SKU*PBG`: skunk
* `PWHR*EUPBG`: blink
* `TKR*UPBG`: drunk

|   Chord    |  Translation  | Notes |
| :--------- | :------------ | :---- |
| `THAPBG` | thank | |
| `THAPBGS` | thanks | |
| `TPRAPBG`    | frank       |  |
| `TPRA*PBG`    | Frank       |  |
| `SHRAO*EPBG`  | slink       | "Sling" and "shrink" occupy the intuitive options for this stroke, so we change the vowel to a tense E sound in order to at least have a way to write it. If you wrote "slink" much more frequently than "shrink" you could swap these definitions. |
| `KHOL` | alcohol |  |
| `KHO*LG` | alcoholic | |
