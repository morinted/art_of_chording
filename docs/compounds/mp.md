# -mp

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how to write words with the -mp suffix like "lump" and "jump".

-------

In Plover Theory, the main way to write words ending in "-mp" is to add an asterisk to the right-hand chord for `-M` (`-PL`):

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
*M
{% endstenodisplay %}

This gives us the ability to write `HUPL` for "hum" and `HU*PL` for "hump".

* `HU*PL`: hump
* `PU*PL`: pump
* `WEU*PL`: wimp
* `KHO*PL`: chomp
* `HRU*PL`: lump
* `KHRA*PL`: clamp
* `SRA*PL`: vamp

### -FRP for -mp

Mirabai, the creator of Plover Theory, prefers using `*PL` for -mp. However, Plover's dictionary also includes the StenEd convention of `-FRP`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-FRP
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `HUFRP`: hump
* `PUFRP`: pump
* `PHRUFRP`: plump

There are potential advantages to writing -mp this way. For one, it opens up the `-L` key which lets us write words that end in -mple unambigously:

- `SEUFRPL`: simple
- `KRUFRPL`: crumple
- `SAFRPL`: sample
- `AFRPL`: ample
