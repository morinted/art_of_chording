# -mp

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how to write words with the -mp suffix like "lump" and "jump".

---

In Plover Theory, the main way to write words ending in "-mp" is to add an asterisk to the right-hand chord for `-M` (`-PL`):

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="*M" />

This gives us the ability to write `HUPL` for "hum" and `HU*PL` for "hump".

- `HU*PL`: hump
- `PU*PL`: pump
- `WEU*PL`: wimp
- `KHO*PL`: chomp
- `HRU*PL`: lump
- `KHRA*PL`: clamp
- `SRA*PL`: vamp

## -FRP for -mp

Mirabai, the creator of Plover Theory, prefers using `*PL` for -mp. However, Plover's dictionary also includes the StenEd convention of `-FRP`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-FRP" />

- `HUFRP`: hump
- `PUFRP`: pump
- `PHRUFRP`: plump

There are potential advantages to writing -mp this way. For one, it opens up the `-L` key which lets us write words that end in -mple unambigously:

- `SEUFRPL`: simple
- `KRUFRPL`: crumple
- `SAFRPL`: sample
- `AFRPL`: ample
