# con-, com-

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how to write words with the con- and com- prefixes like "control" and "compare".

---

When a word starts with con- or com-, there's a good chance you can write that entire sound using just `K-`:

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="K-" />

- `KPAEUR`: compare
- `KPHOPB`: common
- `KPOUPBD`: compound
- `KPWAT`: combat
- `KPAOUT`: compute
- `KPAOURT`: computer
- `KPHAOUPB`: commune
- `KPHAOUPBT`: community
- `KPHRAOET`: complete
- `KPHEUGS`: commission
- `KPHEPBT`: comment
- `KPHEUT`: commit
- `KPHREBGS`: complex
- `KPHAPBD`: command
- `KPWAOEUPB`: combine
- `KPHRAEUPBT`: complaint

## Out of Steno Order

This next set of entries follow a very similar pattern as above, except that the second consonant doesn't follow `K-` in steno order. This can be solved by "deleting" that consonant as long as the result is not a word:

- `KROL`: control
- `KABGT`: contact
- `KRABGT`: contract
- `KEGT`: context
- `KERPB`: concern
- `KEURPL`: confirm

Sometimes, you will need to add in an inversion to get the word you want due to a conflict. For example, `KEPT` is occupied by "kept", so if you want to write concept, you might consider a inversion of the `S` and `K`:

- `SKEPT`: concept

Note that you still cannot write every single con- or com- word. You will learn a few more in the briefs table, but it's not until later that we learn the generic con- and com- prefixes.
