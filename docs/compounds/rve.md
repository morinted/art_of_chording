# -rve

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write the compound "-rve" in words like "curve" and "swerve".

---

The somewhat common compound "-rve" doesn't fit in steno order, and the most obvious choice, `-FR`, is already used for several other endings (like in "offer", "cover"). So, in order to reduce conflicts, we assign it an otherwise unused chord, `-FRB`:

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-FRB" />

Think about the shape of this chord. To me, it always seems like a "cu**rve**" along the edge of the layout.

- `KUFRB`: curve
- `SEFRB`: serve
- `SWEFRB`: swerve
- `KAFRB`: carve
- `SREFRB`: verve
- `TPHEFRB`: nerve

Paired with inversion:

- `STKEFRB`: deserve
