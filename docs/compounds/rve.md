# -rve

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write the compound "-rve" in words like "curve" and "swerve".

-------

The somewhat common compound "-rve" doesn't fit in steno order, and the most obvious choice, `-FR`, is already used for several other endings (like in "offer", "cover"). So, in order to reduce conflicts, we assign it an otherwise unused chord, `-FRB`:

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-FRB
{% endstenodisplay %}

Think about the shape of this chord. To me, it always seems like a "cu**rve**" along the edge of the layout.

* `KUFRB`: curve
* `SEFRB`: serve
* `SWEFRB`: swerve
* `KAFRB`: carve
* `SREFRB`: verve
* `TPHEFRB`: nerve

Paired with inversion:

* `STKEFRB`: deserve
