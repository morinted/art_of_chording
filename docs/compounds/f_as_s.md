# -F as -s

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how to substitute `-F` on the right hand for "s" in words like "fast", "mask", and "schism".

---

Because of steno order, `-S` is very near the end of the layout. That means that we can't write words like "fast" because `TPATS` is "fats". In order to circumvent steno order, we substitute the `-F` key for the "s" sound, which might sound like someone speaking with a lisp. So to get "fast", we write `TPAFT`. We do this whenever we have words ending in -sp, -sk, -sn, -ses, -st, and -sed.

- `PHOFT`: most
- `SKWRUFT`: just
- `TPAFT`: fast
- `HREUFP`: lisp
- `PHAFBG`: mask
- `REUFBG`: risk
- `TRUFT`: trust
- `TPAFPB`: fasten
- `PWAOFT`: boost
- `KAFL`: castle
- `SPAFPL`: spasm
- `PHAFTS`: masts
- `SKEUFPL`: schism
- `TKPWHRAFS`: glasses
- `KHRAFS`: classes
- `PHEUFD`: missed
- `KEUFD`: kissed
- `KEUFG`: kissing

Now you have learned that the `-F` key is used for "f", "v", and sometimes "s". It's a pretty busy key and sometimes there are phonetic conflicts that you need to resolve. For now, look at all the ways that you can use this key:

- `WAFT`: waft
- `WAEUFT`: waist
- `WAFD`: waved

## \*S for -st

Plover Theory prefers using `-FT` for -st in _most_ cases. However, there are times when you need the `-FT` for something else. In these cases, we use a traditional StenEd -st which is `*S`:

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="*S" />

Most words ending in -st in Plover can be written with both `*S` and `-FT`:

- `PHOEFT`: most (Plover Theory)
- `PHO*ES`: most (StenEd)

But there are a few exception that you will have to memorize:

- `TPO*RS`: forest
- `HROFT`: lot of
  - `HRO*S`: lost
  - `HRO*FT`: loft
- `HREUFT`: lift
  - `HR*EUS`: list
- `PHUFL`: muffle
  - `PH*UFL`: muscle

| :------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `TPEURS` | first       | Easier than `TPEUFRT` or `TP*EURS` |
| `EUTS`   | its         | Possessive "it"                    |
