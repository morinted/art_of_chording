# -nch, -rch

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how to write words with the -nch and -rch suffixes like "arch" and "hunch".

### -rch

To end a word with "rch", we use the chord `-FRPB`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-FRPB
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `AFRPB`: arch
* `SEFRPB`: search
* `TOFRPB`: torch
* `POFRPB`: porch
* `PWEUFRPB`: birch
* `HRUFRPB`: lurch
* `PAFRPBD`: parched
* `PHAFRPB`: march
* `KHUFRPB`: church

### -nch

For the most part, `-FRPB` also works for "nch":

* `PWUFRPB`: bunch
* `PWEFRPB`: bench
* `PEUFRPB`: pinch
* `PUFRPB`: punch
* `RAFRPB`: ranch
* `TPREFRPB`: French

However, if there is a collision where a word can end with either rch or nch, such as with "lurch" and "lunch", the -nch word is written with `-FRPBLG`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-FRPBLG
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `HRUFRPBLG`: lunch
  * `HRUFRPB`: lurch
* `PWUFRPBLG`: bunch
* `PUFRPBLG`: punch
* etc.

Note that `-FRPBLG` can also be parsed as "FRJ", such as in "beverage". This is why `PWEFRPBLG` maps to beverage and not "bench". To be honest, the only collision I can find in the default dictionary is lurch and lunch.

|   Chord    |  Translation  | Notes |
| :--------- | :------------ | :---- |
| `HRUPBS`    | lunch       | Because `HRUFRPBLG` is a large chord for a common word |
| `KHEUFRPB`  | children    |        |
| `TPH-FP`    | inch        | `TPH` = in, `-FP` = ch  |
| `REFRPB`    | research    |        |
