# -nch, -rch

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how to write words with the -nch and -rch suffixes like "arch" and "hunch".

## -rch

To end a word with "rch", we use the chord `-FRPB`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-FRPB" />

- `AFRPB`: arch
- `SEFRPB`: search
- `TOFRPB`: torch
- `POFRPB`: porch
- `PWEUFRPB`: birch
- `HRUFRPB`: lurch
- `PAFRPBD`: parched
- `PHAFRPB`: march
- `KHUFRPB`: church

## -nch

For the most part, `-FRPB` also works for "nch":

- `PWUFRPB`: bunch
- `PWEFRPB`: bench
- `PEUFRPB`: pinch
- `PUFRPB`: punch
- `RAFRPB`: ranch
- `TPREFRPB`: French

However, if there is a collision where a word can end with either rch or nch, such as with "lurch" and "lunch", the -nch word is written with `-FRPBLG`.

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="-FRPBLG" />

- `HRUFRPBLG`: lunch
  - `HRUFRPB`: lurch
- `PWUFRPBLG`: bunch
- `PUFRPBLG`: punch
- etc.

Note that `-FRPBLG` can also be parsed as "FRJ", such as in "beverage". This is why `PWEFRPBLG` maps to beverage and not "bench". To be honest, the only collision I can find in the default dictionary is lurch and lunch.
