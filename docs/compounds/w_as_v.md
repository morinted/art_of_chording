# W as v-

_Special thanks to a generous stranger for funding this lesson._

This lesson teaches a trick to write words where there is a "v" following an initial consonant, like in "devour" and "severe".

---

Because "v" is usually made on the left hand with `SR`, it is not possible to combine it with other consonant sounds. To get around this, you can substitute `W`:

<Steno-Display labels="all" stroke="W" />

- `SWAOER`: severe
- `TKWOUR`: devour
- `TKWAOEUD`: divide
- `TKWAOEUS`: device
- `TKWAOEUPB`: divine

Using `K` as "con-" from the last lesson, we can get:

- `KWERS`: converse
- `KWAOEPBT`: convenient
- `KWEUBGT`: convict
- `KWULS`: convulse
- `KWEPBGS`: convention
- `KWERGS`: conversion
- `KWEUBGS`: conviction
- `KWERPBLG`: converge

Be careful, though, because `KW` is already used for Q words. If you are trying to write an uncommon "conv" word, you may need to use multiple strokes, which will be covered in the prefix section of the book. For example, `KWAOEPB` maps to "queen", not "convene".
