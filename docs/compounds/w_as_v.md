# W as v-

_Special thanks to a generous stranger for funding this lesson._

This lesson teaches a trick to write words where there is a "v" following an initial consonant, like in "devour" and "severe".

-------

Because "v" is usually made on the left hand with `SR`, it is not possible to combine it with other consonant sounds. To get around this, you can substitute `W`:

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
W
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `SWAOER`: severe
* `TKWOUR`: devour
* `TKWAOEUD`: divide
* `TKWAOEUS`: device
* `TKWAOEUPB`: divine

Using `K` as "con-" from the last lesson, we can get:

* `KWERS`: converse
* `KWAOEPBT`: convenient
* `KWEUBGT`: convict
* `KWULS`: convulse
* `KWEPBGS`: convention
* `KWERGS`: conversion
* `KWEUBGS`: conviction
* `KWERPBLG`: converge

Be careful, though, because `KW` is already used for Q words. If you are trying to write an uncommon "conv" word, you may need to use multiple strokes, which will be covered in the prefix section of the book. For example, `KWAOEPB` maps to "queen", not "convene".
