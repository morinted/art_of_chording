# Compound Sounds

Now we know all the core sounds in steno theory. This covers all of the letters of the alphabet as well as all the phonemes in English.

Now, we will learn about some compound sounds that are available in Plover Theory. This will let us write words with common affixes, like the "-tion" suffix used in fashion, ration, and caption. We'll also explicitly clarify some patterns that you may have noticed while reading the book so far.

By the end of the chapter you will know:

- All of Plover Theory's sounds
- How to stroke all phonetic single-stroke words
