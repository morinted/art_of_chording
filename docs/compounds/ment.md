# -ment

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write words ending with "ment" like "government" and "basement".

-------

Lots of words end with the suffix "ment". It's made with the right-hand chord `-PLT`:

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-PLT
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `PHOEPLT`: moment
* `TORPLT`: torment
* `HRAPLT`: lament
* `KOPLT`: comment (`KPHEPBT` also works)
* `PAEUPLT`: payment
* `TPERPLT`: ferment
* `SEPLT`: cement
* `KPHREUPLT`: compliment
* `KPHREPLT`: complement

Here are some examples using `-F` and `-R` with `-PLT`:

* `PHRAFPLT`: placement
* `PAEUFPLT`: pavement
* `TKPWARPLT`: garment
* `PHOFPLT`: movement

And finally, here are some examples where we drop consonants in order to get even more complex words out:

* `EUPLT`: implement
* `TKPWOFPLT`: government
* `STAEUPLT`: statement
* `PWAEUFPLT` or `PWAEUPLT`: basement
* `TRAOEPLT`: treatment
* `KPHEUPLT`: commitment
* `TPRAPLT`: fragment
* `TKPARPLT`: department
* `OEUPLT`: ointment
* `SHEUPLT`: shipment
* `SKWRUPLT`: judgment

## Dropping the Initial Syllable

Sometimes, briefs are made by dropping the initial syllable. This is especially the case when the syllable you are writing is uncommon. For example, with the word "English", the first syllable (en) is very common, but the second syllable (glish), never occurs in any other word! So for this reason, we can create a brief for "English" using the syllable "glish".

You've already seen this in the briefs for "begin" (`TKPWEUPB`) and "again" (`TKPWEPB`).

Here are some briefs that follow that pattern.
