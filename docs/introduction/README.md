# Welcome

Thanks for checking out _Art of Chording_. This book's goal is to enable anyone to learn stenography (or steno, for short.)

## Stenography

Stenography is the fastest way to write on a computer. Court reporters have used machine stenography since the late 1800s to create written records of human speech in real-time.

A steno machine can completely replace keyboard usage.

This book is part of the [Open Steno Project](http://openstenoproject.org), whose mission is to *bring stenography to everyone*.
