# Plover

[Plover](http://openstenoproject.org/plover) is an open source application that lets you control your computer with a steno machine.

It also lets you use an [NKRO (n-key rollover) keyboard](http://stenoknight.com/wiki/N-key_rollover) instead of a "real" steno machine.

Hundreds of people have taught themselves stenography with Plover. You don't need to reach 225 words per minute (WPM), the certified court reporter speed in the United States, to get a speed and ergonomics boost over a conventional keyboard.

Plover comes with a built-in theory crafted by its inventor, Mirabai Knight.

This book is written for Plover's dictionary and will work well with Plover as your primary software. However, it is possible to use Plover's dictionary outside of Plover should you decide to pursue a career path in professional stenography where you might required the use of professional CAT (computer-aided transcription) software.
